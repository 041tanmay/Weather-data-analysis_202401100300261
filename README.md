# Weather Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Python project that performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a weather dataset. The project demonstrates how to ingest, clean, and visualize weather data using popular Python libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **numpy**. The code does not employ any machine learning algorithmsâ€”instead, it focuses on uncovering patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

## Problem Statement

The main challenge addressed in this project is transforming raw, heterogeneous weather data into meaningful insights. The objectives include:

- **Data Ingestion and Cleaning:** Handling raw weather data that may contain missing values or inconsistent formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Generating descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlations to understand the distribution and relationships among key weather variables (e.g., temperature, rainfall, humidity).
- **Insight Extraction:** Identifying trends over time, detecting anomalies, and understanding the relationships between weather attributes.

## Approach and Methodology

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   The dataset is embedded directly within the code as a multi-line CSV string, which simplifies running the project as a standalone script without needing a separate data file.
  
2. **Data Exploration:**  
   The script uses pandas to load and preview the data, providing a summary including column names, data types, and basic statistics.
  
3. **Visualization:**  
   - **Histograms:** To show the distribution of numerical features.
   - **Line Plot:** To visualize temperature changes over time (or index).
   - **Scatter Plots:** To explore relationships between temperature, humidity, and rainfall.
   - **Correlation Matrix:** Calculated and visualized as a heatmap to identify inter-variable relationships.
  
4. **Insight Extraction:**  
   Analysis of data distributions and visualizations helps derive insights on seasonal trends, variability, and relationships between weather variables, which can inform further analysis or decision-making.

## Technologies Used
